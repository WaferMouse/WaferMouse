## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jocelyne! My pronouns are she/her. I've worked on a lot of things over the years, below are a few of my favourite projects:

### WES_offline - https://github.com/WaferMouse/WES_offline
A tool to decode the result from the QR code generated by Casio Classwiz calculators without needing an internet connection.

### L3-37 - https://github.com/WaferMouse/L3-37
A multitool plugin for the Elite Dangerous Market Connector tool, a third-party tool for Elite Dangerous. No longer supported or developed, but stands as my longest running project so far.

### durden - https://github.com/WaferMouse/durden
A work-in-progress graphics editor that targets the Sega Mega Drive.

### mcInstaglam - https://github.com/WaferMouse/mcInstaglam
Very old, a Python script to automate rendering a Minecraft world in blender based on a text file.
